# EthSignals Manifesto

## Purpose

### Background

The project was inspired by the [Phil Lucsok and Griff Green presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bQiSw8UveVT_R2f3Yhla61ad6FRefptf/view) at EthMagicians in Berlin on July 2018. The working group was formed shortly afterwards. The project was funded on [Giveth](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b51bdbdf8ba4732631989f5) by Griff Green, then with the [Aragon Nest grant](https://github.com/aragon/nest/pull/66) and later on [GitCoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/85/tennagraph-minimum-bias-ethereum-signal-aggregat-2) and [WeTrust](https://cryptounlocked.wetrust.io/tennagraph). Collectively over $43k was attracted for the development and community work. Currently the funds are managed through [Aragon DAO](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/tenna.aragonid.eth/0x77886861218199f5d98c86f4e707a071cbb82ea5). Info on the team:

## Strategy

### Increase the volume of signaling

* Creating more awareness about most important EIPs, importance of signaling and Tennagraph as the tools
  * Doing promotional campaigns in Twitter on specific EIPs \(e.g. [EIP-1559](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1559-fee-market-change-for-eth-1-0-chain/2783/8)\)
  * Manual verification and attaching influencers stances to Tenna
  * Engaging the EIP writers in signaling promotion
  * Including overview/links in relevant media \(coindesk, [eth website](https://www.ethereum.org/), [eth github](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Governance-compendium) and satellite resources\)
  * Arrange talks on the conferences \(e.g. web3, ethBerlin, magicians\) & podcasts \(e.g. Zero Knowledge\)
  * Allow setting signal collection bounties from EF and other parties
  * Attract advisors into popularization \(tweets why they advise us etc\)
  * Create an agreement with major dapps dev on signaling
  * Making public report on the work
* Add a plugin for Chrome to inject voting mechanics in EIP github interface
* Make cleaner website with more info 
  * Add the mission statement \([example](https://coin.dance/)\)
  * Add roadmap - with potentially numbers that we want to reach out - get
  * Add “about” 
  * Add FAQs
  * Short description of EIP - but you can click on it and see it full afterwards 
  * Add socials - twitter & telegram
* Make educational media format \(like video\) with the EIP overview

### Simplify the signal collection

* List the open topics for signaling – Hudson?
* Separate the influencers & majority opinion
  * Local / Manual signal collection on conferences
  * Connect more identity data

### Increase the Team Capacity

* Raise $5k / mo. budget for next 6 months – Fundraiser
  * Create Moloch request \(Ameen, Griff, Jamie P, Yalda, Kevin, Hudson, Cassandra, Eric Conner EIP-1559 - need 4 votes\)
  * Promote Gitcoin
  * ECF & EF
  * Aragon
* Conduct regular reporting \(progress, financial\)
* Open up a working group around the topic
* Setup advisor agreements+process
  * Hudson
  * EthMagicians \(Jamie, Boris?\)
  * Gitcoin
  * Aragon
  * Griff
  * Anna

## Policies

* Governance: We use holacracy framework
* Coordination: Be-weekly calls
* Finance: _\*\*_[Cashflow](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rivtjkYQXm2M0ZxqW-ISe3pkRyKpl8frFsAEertS8S0/edit?usp=sharing) is open
