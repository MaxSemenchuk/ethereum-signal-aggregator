## Bohdan / Moloch grant

Rejected in the last day, Hudson couldn't vote on behalf of EF. Was some critics about only one EIP – lack of traction. Plan – reapply in some time after more traction maybe ~month.

## Bohdan / Hackathon

Our goal: update the system with additional chrome plugin to be able

1. seeing voting results in the EIP github page 
2. being able to cast a vote on-chain
3. and with influencer account
   * being to able to connect your twitter account with plugin
4. Receive notifications on EIPs that need signals and overall events
5. Own wallet for voting

## Max / Relevant EIPs + What info we want to get

Need to talk to Hudson to define the EIPs we want to collect info on

* What data makes good signaling
* Which EIPs we need to focus on,
* Need help with ethmagicians participation

## Max / Website update

Added EIP 2025 voting
